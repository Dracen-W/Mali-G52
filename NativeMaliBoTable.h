/* One client's buffer objects: allocation, mapping into its one GPU address
 * space, the CPU token, and retirement.
 *
 * This is the state machine the IOUserClient will dispatch into. It is pure:
 * no IOKit object, no register of its own, no policy the wrapper would have to
 * repeat. Everything that touches hardware goes through the injected
 * NativeMaliMemorySource, NativeMaliVm and NativeMaliMmu, which is why the host
 * test can run the real page tables and the real LOCK/FLUSH_PT sequence against
 * fake registers.
 *
 * Shape (NativeAdrenoUserClient.h:29-46 and .cpp:121-324, MIT, see NOTICE; no
 * code copied):
 *   - a handle is this object's own identity, never a VM address, an IOVA or a
 *     pointer. It is handed out monotonically, so a stale handle from a freed
 *     object cannot name a newer one.
 *   - an object is retirable only through freeBo(), which unmaps first and then
 *     releases the backing memory; if either step fails the object stays live
 *     so the call can be repeated. That is also the order panfrost uses
 *     (panfrost_mmu.c:500-524 clears the leaves, then the GEM pages go).
 *   - a CPU mapping is a token, not a second handle: the wrapper's
 *     clientMemoryForType() maps the memory it names. A BO with a live token is
 *     not freed, because the wrapper still has it mapped.
 *   - teardown drops the CPU tokens first (the connection that held them is
 *     going away, as in NativeAdrenoUserClient::releaseAll()) and then frees
 *     each BO.
 *
 * Mapping permissions: the wire ABI requires read and lets the caller add
 * write (NativeMaliABI.h). panfrost always maps IOMMU_READ | IOMMU_WRITE |
 * IOMMU_CACHE (panfrost_mmu.c:466-493), so the read-only case is the only
 * difference here: it is honoured because the LPAE encoder can express it, and
 * a GPU write to such a mapping then faults instead of silently succeeding.
 *
 * Deliberately not here: choosing the address space (the client owns one, the
 * service allocates it), deciding which IOVA to use (the ABI's caller-chosen
 * address, as NativeMaliMemory::map() takes it), job submission and fences
 * (NativeMaliJobSlot), and any call into XNU.
