 *     i < hweight32(js_present), the 64-bit present bitmaps (LO | HI << 32)
 *     and THREAD_TLS_ALLOC.
 *   drivers/gpu/drm/panfrost/panfrost_gpu.c:309-312
 *     nr_core_groups = hweight64(l2_present).
 *   drivers/gpu/drm/panfrost/panfrost_device.h:61-92
 *     the field widths (js_features[16], 64-bit present bitmaps).
 *   drivers/gpu/drm/panfrost/panfrost_gpu.c:117-180
 *     panfrost_gpu_init_quirks(): the SC_* shader-config bits, the tiler clock
 *     gate override and the JM_CONFIG IDVS group size.
 *   drivers/gpu/drm/panfrost/panfrost_features.h:73-83 and
 *     panfrost_issues.h:141-142,248
 *     the G52 feature and issue bits the quirk branches test.

 *     panfrost_gpu_irq_handler(): GPU_FAULT_STATUS plus the
 *     GPU_FAULT_ADDRESS_HI/LO pair, decoded by NativeMaliFault::exceptionName().
 *   drivers/gpu/drm/panfrost/panfrost_regs.h
 *     the register offsets, generated into NativeMaliRegs.h.
 *
 * Deliberately not read yet: AFBC, texture and coherency features. panfrost
 * reads them in the same function, but nothing before M5 uses them, and the
 * coherency register only exists on models with HW_FEATURE_COHERENCY_REG. They
 * will be added together with the model feature table, not guessed now.
 *
 * Safety: 0x13040000 may only be read while the MFG domains, the topckgen mux
 * and the mfgcfg gate are up (M2). probe() asks NativeMaliPower::gpuReadable()
 * first and returns its error without touching the GPU target. That is the M1
 * rule "read SPM before the GPU" encoded as a precondition rather than a
 * comment.
 *
 * No register is written by probe() or readFault(). softReset() is the first
 * write: it sits behind NATIVE_MALI_M3_WRITES (default 0) and behind the same
 * M2 gate.
