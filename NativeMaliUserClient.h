/* One client of the GPU: its buffer objects, its one address space, and the
 * jobs it started. This is what the future NativeMaliService IOUserClient will
 * dispatch into; it is pure (no IOKit object, no register of its own), so the
 * host test can run the real page tables and the real job-slot handshake
 * against fake registers.
 *
 * Shape (NativeAdrenoUserClient.h, MIT, see NOTICE; nothing copied): the client
 * owns its objects, hands out its own fences, keeps the counters GetStatus
 * reports, and is usable only while open.
 *
 * Submission (panfrost_job.c):
 *   - The source never lets a client pick a job slot: panfrost_job_get_slot()
 *     derives it from the job's requirements (FS -> JS0, else JS1, compute ->
 *     JS2 under the issue guards). This ABI deliberately carries no
 *     requirements (NativeMaliABI.h), so the honest policy is "the first slot
 *     that is present and idle", round-robin from the last one used. A client
 *     that wants a particular slot cannot express it, and does not need to:
 *     every slot runs the same chain format.
 *   - The chain head must be inside one of this client's live mappings; a GPU
 *     address the client never mapped is refused before any register is
 *     written. panfrost gets the same guarantee from the GEM mapping it looks
 *     the job up in.
 *   - The flush id is read per submission from GPU_LATEST_FLUSH_ID
 *     (panfrost_gpu_get_latest_flush_id(), panfrost_gpu.c:561-573), exactly
 *     where panfrost_job_hw_submit() reads it; it is never the client's to
 *     choose.
 *   - The fence is the slot's emit seqno (panfrost_job.c:106), packed as the
 *     ABI documents. A dependency fence and WaitFence must be one this client
 *     was handed: each slot keeps the highest seqno this client submitted
 *     there. A seqno above that is another client's (or not submitted yet) and
 *     is refused, so this client cannot reap someone else's completion. A
 *     seqno below it that this client skipped belongs to another client's
 *     earlier job on the same slot; the slot runs one job at a time, so that
 *     job must already have been reaped and fenceSignaled() answers true
 *     without touching the hardware.
 *   - Completion is polled synchronously (NativeMaliJobSlot), so a wait here
 *     blocks. The interrupt-driven form is still blocked on
 *     docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md item 14.
 *
 * Counters: `faults` counts reaped completions whose exception is a fault
 * (NativeMaliJobCompletion::isFault(), the source's reset-worthy set); the
 * service calls noteReset() when it resets the GPU. A changed faults or resets
 * is how userspace learns that older fences are dead (NativeMaliABI.h).
 * noteReset() additionally remembers the one seqno per slot that was in flight
 * at that moment, so waiting on exactly that fence returns IOError (an error
 * fence, as panfrost signals) rather than timing out on a job the reset
 * destroyed. Unlike a reaped ERR it does not advance `faults`: the GPU was
 * reset, not the job faulted.
 *
 * Not here: allocating the address space (the service does that), the MMU
 * enable/disable around it, GPU resets, and the IOUserClient object itself.
