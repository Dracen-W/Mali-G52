/* The wire ABI between the (future) NativeMaliService IOUserClient and a
 * userspace GPU driver.
 *
 * This is not the IOKit ABI and not an ioctl: the service copies exactly these
 * fixed-size records across its external methods. All fields are little endian;
 * both sides are ARM64. Every array lives inside one record, so a caller cannot
 * pass a length that disagrees with the storage. An unknown version, method or
 * flag bit is refused, never ignored.
 *
 * The set of methods is what the driver can actually honour today:
 *   Query, GetDeviceInfo          read-only facts (M1/M3 probe output)
 *   BoAlloc, BoMap, BoFree        NativeMaliMemory (M5)
 *   BoCpuMap, BoCpuUnmap          the caller's CPU view of a BO
 *   Submit, WaitFence             NativeMaliJob + NativeMaliJobSlot (M6)
 *   GetStatus                     fault and reset counters
 *   Reset                         device-wide recovery after a fault
 *
 * Reset is deliberately device-wide, not per client: there is one GPU, one job
 * manager and one MMU, so a state that wedges a slot cannot be recovered inside
 * one address space. Any connected caller may issue it (the service has no
 * finer permission model than "opened the service", the same boundary Submit
 * crosses). It carries no records: the selector is the whole request. The call
 * destroys every client's in-flight job, so those fences answer IOError through
 * WaitFence and GetStatus::resets advances for every client; the page tables
 * are then programmed again from the software state that survived, so BOs and
 * mappings stay valid. Without it the first job fault would make the device
 * unusable until the driver is reloaded. Adding it does not change the version:
 * a v1 client that predates the selector never calls it, and a v1 driver that
 * predates it answers kIOReturnUnsupported.
 *
 * Deliberately absent, with the reason:
 *   - CreateQueue/CloseQueue. A queue would be an address space, and this
 *     device has three present address spaces (GPU_AS_PRESENT == 0x7, see
 *     docs/DEVICE.md) shared by every client. One address space per client is
 *     what the driver can guarantee; a client that could open several would
 *     starve the others. Submit therefore names no queue.
 *   - a job-slot field. The three job slots are shared hardware; the service
 *     picks a free one, the way panfrost's scheduler does, and returns Busy
 *     when none is free. A slot number is not the client's to choose.
 *   - BoImport. Pinning a caller's own pages needs a memory source that can
 *     describe them (IOBufferMemoryDescriptor or an IOSurface); the host-tested
 *     NativeMaliMemorySource cannot yet (docs/OPEN_QUESTIONS.md item 5).
 *   - requirements/affinity. panfrost computes the shader-core affinity from
 *     the job's requirements; this driver drives JS_AFFINITY_NEXT with
 *     features.shader_present, "use all cores for now"
 *     (panfrost_job.c:135-151). Advertising a requirements field the driver
 *     ignores would be a lie.
 *   - flush id. The service reads GPU_LATEST_FLUSH_ID itself
 *     (NativeMaliGpuCore), so the client cannot pick one.
 *
 * Sizes and the arithmetic behind the constants:
 *   - 4 KiB is the only page size NativeMaliVm maps (NativeMaliVmGranule).
 *   - 128 MiB is NativeMaliVmMaxTables (64) * NativeMaliVmPtesPerTable (512) *
 *     NativeMaliVmGranule (4096) = 2^27: one buffer cannot need more leaves
 *     than the page-table budget of the address space it lives in.
 *   - 64 bytes is the v7 job header size and its required alignment
 *     (NativeMaliJobHeadAlignment, from mesa v7.xml:1334-1351).
 *
 * The conventions - fixed-size records with the arrays inside them, a version
 * field that must match, unknown flags refused rather than ignored, and
 * static_assert on every layout - follow NativeAdrenoABI.h (MIT, see NOTICE).
 * None of its records or constants are copied: the fields here are the ones
 * this driver can honour, listed above.
 *
 * A fence is opaque to userspace: nonzero, produced by Submit, consumed by
 * WaitFence. The driver packs (job slot, emit_seqno) into it - the low 32 bits
 * are NativeMaliJobSlot's seqno and the high 32 its slot - but that layout may
 * change with the ABI version, so a client must round-trip it, not decode it.
 *
 * Dispatch: every method number fixes exactly one input record and one output
 * record (either may be absent), and the sizes are exactly the structs below.
 * A wrapper rejects any other size before copying, and writes no output byte
 * unless the call succeeded. NativeMaliUserClient::dispatch() is that rule in
 * code; the IOUserClient subclass only copies memory around it.
